# Task Management System

A simple Task Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This system includes basic user authentication and CRUD operations for managing tasks.

## Features

### Backend (Node.js & Express)
- JWT-based authentication for secure user login and registration.
- Password encryption using bcrypt.
- CRUD operations for tasks, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
- Basic error handling for API endpoints.

### Frontend (React)
- User registration and login forms.
- Basic task list dashboard to display all tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**: For storing user and task data.
- **Express.js**: For creating RESTful APIs.
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: For server-side logic.
- **JWT**: For user authentication.
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.

## Installation
